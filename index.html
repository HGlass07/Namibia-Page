                <p>
                    Clothing, language, art, music, sport, food and religion are only a 
                    few things which defines a Namibia safari. There are at least 11 major 
                    ethnic groups which characterize Namibia’s very rich and diverse culture. 
                    Namibia is also home to the distinctive Khoisan “click” which is spoken 
                    by the indigenous people of Southern Africa.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Proud Namibians however, aren’t 
                    the only thing one can experience whilst on a safari in this rugged Southern 
                    African Country. Namibia might well be Africa’s most beautiful Country with 
                    the most interesting places such as vast landscapes and safari locations 
                    ranging from unworldly and unrealistic sand dunes, to glorious mountain ranges, 
                    and river-carved canyons to golden-grassed plains of the Kalahari stretching 
                    as far as the eye can see.

                    Best Time to Visit
                </h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The best time to visit Namibia to see wildlife will certainly be in the dry season 
                        (June to October) when animals gather close to scarce water sources in the National Parks. 
                        June and July nights can be as low as freezing in some parts of the country. January and 
                        February are usually the hottest months of the year making the visit unpleasant to some.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rainfall usually occurs inland during the summer from November to April in the form of 
                        thundershowers. Bird watching will be best during this rainy season. Mosquito numbers 
                        however increase during this period as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        So, when is the best time to visit Namibia? The short answer is, Namibia is a year-round 
                        destination. It all depends on where you go and what you want to see, just pack accordingly.
